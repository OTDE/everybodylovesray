# Everybody Loves Ray: A Simple, Java-based Ray Tracer

This is a ray tracer that was built by Ethan Wiederspan and Seth Chapman for their 2018-2019 Computer Science capstone project.
It supports OBJ and MTL files, read through a JSON specification file, an example of which is provided in the repo.
Reflective and refractive objects are supported. The renderer assumes all objects are triangle meshes.
